# Destiny

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Billy. Billy always had a tingly feeling in him. He asked his mom what that feeling meant. You need to find your destiny, she said.

Because his mom said to find, Billy thought he really needed to leave home to find his destiny. So he packed up his things and set off on a journey in his little boat.

He went to America, Spain, Japan, and Antarctica and all over the world. While he was travelling, he felt home sick and then he thought that he had failed his quest. So he got to his little boat and sailed though the sea to get back home sadly.

When he got home, he stopped feeling so queasy and his tingly feeling went away too. When he saw his mom, he ran to her and gave her a hug. Then he realised that his destiny is not to be found in somewhere else and it is to be found within him.
