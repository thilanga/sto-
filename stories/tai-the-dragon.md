# Tai the Dragon

There was once a dragon named Tai. Tai was different from other dragons because he was small. He was always being picked on by his size at dragon school. Everyday when he got back from school his mother would ask, “How was your day?” Tai would always say, “I got picked on.” Then his mother would always say “It doesn’t matter how small you are” but everyday it got worse and worse for Tai.

On the day before his 7th birthday, he had the worse day ever. A dragon that wasn’t good at Maths swapped his paper with Tai’s. Tai got F for that when he was supposed to get A+. The dragon that swapped Tai’s paper was Chet. Every time Chet sees Tai, he would say “Oh. Look. There is shorty.” On Tai’s birthday, he told his mom “I’m tired of being picked on. It’s everyday!” Then he ran to his room before his mother could say another word, he packed up his stuff and flew out the window hoping that he could find dragons of his size.

Tai searched day and night but not a single dragon of his size could be found. With water in his eyes, Tai went to a tree to rest for the night. He saw a dragon in distance but when it came closer, it was Chet. Tai asked him “What are you doing out here”. Then Chet said, “I am the biggest dragon of my kind. So I left home to find a dragon my size”. When Tai told what he was doing, both of the dragons laughed.  Then Tai remembered that tomorrow is the Great Dragon Relay. He said Chet that they need to return to their hometown to enter the race because their class is competing against Dragon vile Primary School. So they both returned to their town and got ready for the race.


The next day, all the dragons in Tai’s class lined up at the starting line next to Dragon vale Primary. When they got in their places, the whistle blew. Tai flew as fast as he could. He started thinking about all the mean things that dragons have said to him but he ignored what he thought and flew as fast as anyone. His team got closer to the finish line and they won!! When Tai got home from school, he told his mom “I don’t care how small I am. I will always be special!”

The end.
